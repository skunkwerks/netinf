Some tests for NI libraries.

- tcd.spki is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo value from an X.509 public key
certificate, this is used in the examples from the I-D
- hw.txt is a file containing the string "Hellow World!" (with no
CR), this is also used in the examples from the I-D
- doit is a bash script that calls other things to test 'em

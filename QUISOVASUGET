Grossmutti's advice to those starting to suck the ni URI egg:

- The semi-colon (;) is a meta-character (statement terminator) 
  in all known species of *nix shell
- Complete ni URI's contain a semi-colon
- If you don't quote ni URIs on shell command lines than you will 
  get some peculiar error messages.

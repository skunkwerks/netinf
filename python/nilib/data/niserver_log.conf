# 
# Logger configuration for NI lightweight HTTP server
# 
# Configuration for Python logging using logging.config module.
# Writes log file niserver.log in the log_base directory.
# The log_base has to exist before the server is started and must
# be writable by the niserver process.  The normal logger used for niserver
# is niserver (surprise!) but you can write alternative and configure
# them to be used in the main niserver config file.
#
# The niserver logger used a TimedRotating handler that rotates log files
# on a daily basis.

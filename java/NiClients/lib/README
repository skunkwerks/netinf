# NiClients need following JARs that are not included, so you need to download those
# and add your project/classpath or use ivy.xml if you have ivy installed to automatically download missing dependencies. Note also that in the list below are the versions 
# that was used in the SW development and testing, so other versions of the listed 
# JARs might work as well, but have not been tested.

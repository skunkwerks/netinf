# General:
#
# This is 1st version of NiClients. It has been integration tested with java 
# NiProxy (pubni, regni and getni) and supports current version NI protocol. 
#
# Usage:
#
# Pubni: (To publish with content)
#
# java -jar pubni.jar -f <file> -a <authority> -l <destination>
# 
# E.g. java -jar pubni.jar -f d:/foo -a foo_authority -l http://localhost:8084
# 
# Regni: (To publish content location
#
# java -jar regni.jar -n <niname> -u <location list> -l <destination>
#
# E.g. java -jar regni.jar -l http://localhost:8082 
#			   -n ni://foo_authority/sha-256;qwer1234 
# 			   -u nihttp://localhost:8083 nihttp://localhost:8084
#			   
#
# Getni: (To (recursively) get content)
#
# java -jar getni.jar -n <niname> -l <destination> [-o output file]
#
# E.g. java -jar getni.jar -n ni://foo_authority/sha-256;qwer1234 
#		           -l http://localhost:8083
#			   -o /tmp/output_foo 
#
# Getni can retrieve location list or content. It also recursively gets content content from 
# received location lists. Namely, location in the location list may result another location
# list, with new locations. Getni will search through them all until all locations are checked
# or content is received.

This is a starter for a C library and tools for
ni URIs. 

- LICENSE is an Apache License under which this is
  all released
- nicl.cc is a main() program for generating and verifying 
  the hashes in ni names
- nameurl is a bash script that uses wget to fetch an HTTP
  URL and generate a ni name for that content
- ni.h is the library header file
- ni.cc is the implementation

(Note that the files below are really early codesprint stuff and may or
may not be here going forward.)

- doit is a bash script that calls test
- test.cc is a main() program for adding test cases, now superseded
  by the ../test/doit script really
- foo and bar (in the samples directory) are files used in old tests

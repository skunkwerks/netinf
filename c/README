This is a starter for a C library and tools for
ni names.

- LICENSE is an Apache License under which this is
  all released
- doit is a bash script that calls test
- nicl.cc is a main() program for generating and verifying 
  the hashes in ni names
- nameurl is a bash script that uses wget to fetch an HTTP
  URL and generate a ni name for that URL
- ni.h is the library header file
- ni.cc is the implementation
- Makefile builds stuff, doesn't actually make a .so yet
- foo and bar (in the samples directory) are files used in tests

- test.cc is a main() program for adding test cases, now superseded
  by the ../test/doit script really

(Note that the files below are really early codesprint stuff and may or
may not be here going forward.)

These forme and php scripts go with the ni-my-site.sh web site.

This is currently live on village.n4c.eu with NetInf GET
working at http://village.n4c.eu/getform.html. Code that
uses this needs to POST the form to 
	http://village.n4c.eu/.well-known/netinfproto
or
	http://village.n4c.eu/.well-known/netinfproto/get
(either should work, only tested the 1st so far)

There is a list of NI name well-known URLs at:
	http://village.n4c.eu/wku-list

You need to add a ScriptAlias in Apache's virtual host stanza to point
.well-known/netinfproto at fetcher.php etc.  See the apache-cfg-snippet file
for more.

fetcher.php - do a NetInf GET
putter.php - do a NetInf PUT
getform.html - form for triggering a NetInf GET
getputform.html - form for triggering a NetInf GET or PUT
	- just starting this, not yet working

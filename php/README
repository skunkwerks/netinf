These php scripts go with the ni-my-site.sh web site.

This is currently live on village.n4c.eu with NetInf GET
working at http://village.n4c.eu/getform.html. Code that
uses this needs to POST the form to 
	http://village.n4c.eu/netinfproto
or
	http://village.n4c.eu/netinfproto/get
(either should work)

There is a list of NI name well-known URLs at:
	http://village.n4c.eu/netinfproto/wku-list

You need to add various ScriptAlias directives in Apache's virtual host stanza
to point /netinfproto/get at fetcher.php etc.  See the apache-cfg-snippet file
for more.

fetcher.php - do a NetInf GET
putter.php - do a NetInf PUT
wku-list.php - print the known ni URIs here
wku-get.php - return a 307 for a ni URI that lives in normal DocRoot
  or direct content if it was NetInf PUT'd (and lives in .well-known)
getform.html - form for triggering a NetInf GET
getputform.html - form for triggering a NetInf GET or PUBLISH

---- 2012-06-26 starting over to make a PHP NetInf server

NetInf HTTP CL messages supported:

Temp thing: http://etherpad.verkstad.net/JFIxVaa8TV SCRUB BEFORE RELEASE

GET (N-GET.php)
	- Check for content locally
	- if present, return file
	- else if locator known, return locator (locators only get known via PUBLISH)
	- else return 404

PUBLISH (N-PUBLISH.php)
	- (what if I have object or know locator already?)
	- if fullObj and valid then store locally
	- else return 404

SEARCH - TBD
	- 404 for now

N-lib.php : library functions for the above

Storage:
	- Need some simple native-ish way of storing things
	- Want some kind of pluggability (maybe via netinffs FUSE)

These php scripts go with the ni-my-site.sh web site.

The scripts supportthe following specifications:

This is currently live on village.n4c.eu with NetInf GET
working at http://village.n4c.eu/getform.html. Code that
uses this needs to POST the form to 
	http://village.n4c.eu/netinfproto
or
	http://village.n4c.eu/netinfproto/get
(either should work)

There is a list of NI name well-known URLs at:
	http://village.n4c.eu/netinfproto/wku-list

You need to add various ScriptAlias directives in Apache's virtual host stanza
to point /netinfproto/get at fetcher.php etc.  See the apache-cfg-snippet file
for more.

fetcher.php - do a NetInf GET
putter.php - do a NetInf PUT
wku-list.php - print the known ni URIs here
wku-get.php - return a 307 for a ni URI that lives in normal DocRoot
  or direct content if it was NetInf PUT'd (and lives in .well-known)
getform.html - form for triggering a NetInf GET
getputform.html - form for triggering a NetInf GET or PUBLISH

SEARCH - (N-SEARCH.php)
    - takes a search string (tokens) and searches wikipedia for the first
      10 matching thigs, then gets those, generates ni names and caches
      them and returns a list of 'em
    - they get added to .well-known etc as well

N-lib.php : library functions for the above
